# Social Media Engagement Forecasting Web App
by **Meredith Wang**

September 2022 - Present

# Description
TikTok, a video sharing and relatively new social media platform (funded in 2016), has gained tremendous amount of popularity over the past few years. Understanding their "success metric" and knowing how to attract engagement is extremely important for business and individuals who want to develop their presence on there.

This APP is an additional component to the project for both technical and non-technical skate-holders to grasp the key findings. If you are interested in the "behind-the-scene", please feel free to visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/Social-Media-Capstone/Social-Media-Engagement-Forecasting).
